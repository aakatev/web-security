# Welcome to Web Secuirty Reference!

Before you [get started](get-started.md), the current document was born as part of my personal research on topic of security related to Software (SW), and specifically Web Applications. It is by no means comprehensive, but can be a good place to start getting familiar with the most common threats developers face on the World Wide Web (WWW). Each section aims to introduce a problem, or a technology. Briefly give to a reader an overview of the issue, and provide references for the further research.

Remember, no single attack is more powerful that the others, and successful exploits combine multiple various attacks and techniques. It is important to know weak spots of your system to predict what vectors of attack a hacker can use.

Finally, the document is updated all the time, and reader may expect to see new sections to be added in the future.
