# Web Security Reference

#### Welcome to Web Secuirty Reference!

The current document was born as part of my personal research on topic of security related to Software (SW), and specifically Web Applications. It is by no means comprehensive, but can be a good place to start getting familiar with the most common threats developers face on the World Wide Web (WWW). Each section aims to introduce a problem, or a technology. Briefly give to a reader an overview of the issue, and provide references for the further research.

Finally, the document is updated all the time, and reader may expect to see new sections to be added in the future.

## Get Started

#### [General security](general/README.md)

Section about topics related to general security, like OWASP or Threat Model.

#### [Web security](web/README.md)

Section about topics related to web security, like XSS and CSRF attacks or HTTPS downgrade vulnerability.
